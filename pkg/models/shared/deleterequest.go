// DeleteRequestFilter - Delete documents which matching specified filter. A filter can simply be key, value where key is the field name and value would be the value for this field. Or a filter can be logical where two or more fields can be logically joined using $or and $and. A few examples of filter: <li> To delete a user document where the id has a value 1: ```{"id": 1 }``` <li> To delete all the user documents where the key "id" has a value 1 or 2 or 3: `{"$or": [{"id": 1}, {"id": 2}, {"id": 3}]}`
